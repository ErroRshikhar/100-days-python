100 Days of Python Projects 🚀🐍

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! 🎉
This is my personal coding journal where I’ve documented 100+ projects created while learning and mastering Python programming — from basics to advanced concepts.

About the Challenge

Inspired by the popular “100 Days of Code” format, I committed to coding every single day for 100 days. Each day introduced me to a new concept in Python, and I applied it by building a real-world project. This journey wasn’t just about learning syntax, but about solving problems, experimenting, and building creative and functional applications.

What’s Inside?

Beginner Projects: Simple calculators, higher or lower, coffee machine🎲

Intermediate Projects: APIs, web scraping, data visualization 📊

Advanced Projects: Flask web apps, GUI tools, and even creative coding like Hirst-style paintings 🎨

Automation Scripts: Time-saving tools for everyday tasks ⚡


Why This Repo?

I wanted a single place to showcase my growth and help others who want to start their Python journey. You can explore my projects in chronological order, check out the code, and even try them yourself!

Tech Stack

Python 3 🐍

Turtle Graphics, Flask, Pandas, Tkinter, APIs & more
